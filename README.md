# Detecting and addressing change

Code for my Master Thesis: ***How to detect and address changes in machine learning based data pipelines***

## Installation

Before cloning the repository, make sure that you have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed because the `assets` folder is tracked using it. Then run:
```bash
git lfs clone git@github.com:BogdanFloris/detecting-and-addressing-change.git
```

Note that cloning also works with the normal `git clone` but the performance is worse.
